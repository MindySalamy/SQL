--For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
--Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
--Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

--Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

--Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

select * from BIT_DB.Spotifydata;

--How many tracks does the artist Olivia Rodrigo have and which one was the most popular?
select artist_name, track_name, popularity
from BIT_DB.Spotifydata
where artist_name = 'Olivia Rodrigo'
order by popularity desc;

--Which artist has the least popular track and what is the name?
select distinct artist_name, track_name, popularity
from BIT_DB.Spotifydata
order by popularity asc limit 1;

--Who are the top 5 artists based on popularity?
select artist_name, track_name, popularity
from BIT_DB.Spotifydata
order by popularity desc
limit 5;
